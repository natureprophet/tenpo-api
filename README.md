# ðŸš€ Tenpo API backend challenge

API interview challenge build for [Tenpo](https://www.tenpo.cl/)

This API consists of two endpoints, one to obtain the sum of two numbers, adding a percentage obtained
from an external service, and another endpoint to retrieve the history of calls made to the previous endpoint.

### Instructions to run the API

```
 1. git clone https://github.com/natureprophet/tenpo-api.git
 2. cd tenpo-api
 3. docker-compose up
```
The API container is also published on https://hub.docker.com/r/simongs89/tenpo-api, so you can run the docker compose 
using the local build or the remote one, both options are included on the docker-compose.yml file.
